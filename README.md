# Batch Image & Signal Processing — Course Project

**Project goal:** process a large collection of images or signal files (hundreds of small, or tens of large) and produce reproducible outputs showing the program runs successfully.

This repo contains:
- `src/process_images.py` — batch image operations (resize, grayscale, histogram).
- `src/process_signals.py` — batch signal operations (load WAV/CSV, FFT, spectrogram CSV).
- `scripts/` — example dataset download helpers.
- `outputs/` — autogenerated outputs to commit back as proof.

## How to run (local / lab environment)

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
